# Title: Predicting Bank Customer Churn Using Machine Learning Methods

The diploma study focused on predicting bank customer churn utilizing machine learning methods. Customer churn, which refers to the phenomenon of customers ending their relationship with a bank, is a crucial concern for financial institutions. By developing accurate prediction models, banks can proactively identify potential churners and implement appropriate retention strategies to mitigate customer attrition.

The study employed various machine learning techniques to analyze a dataset obtained from Kaggle. The dataset encompassed a wide range of customer attributes, such as demographic information, transactional behavior, product usage, and customer satisfaction metrics. These attributes were selected as potential predictors of customer churn.

To develop robust models for predicting customer churn, they first conducted data analysis to gain insight into the dataset. Feature distributions and correlations were examined and data preprocessing was done, including subtracting missing data and scaling features. Customer segmentation by clustering was also carried out and portraits of customers inclined to leave and those inclined to stay were identified. In addition, some hypotheses were tested.

Next, several machine learning algorithms were implemented and evaluated to determine their effectiveness in predicting customer churn. The algorithms employed included logistic regression, decision trees, random forests. Model performance was assessed using appropriate evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Furthermore, the study investigated feature importance to identify the most influential factors contributing to customer churn. This analysis enabled the researchers to gain insights into the underlying causes and potential churn triggers. The findings could be utilized by banks to improve customer retention strategies and enhance customer satisfaction.

The diploma study demonstrated that machine learning techniques can effectively predict bank customer churn. The results indicated that certain customer attributes, such as low account activity,  age, number of products used, loyalty, were strongly associated with churn. By identifying these factors, banks can proactively intervene and implement personalized retention strategies, ultimately reducing customer churn rates.

In conclusion, this diploma study provided valuable insights into predicting bank customer churn using machine learning methods. The research highlighted the significance of employing advanced analytics to address the challenges posed by customer churn in the banking industry. The findings and predictive models developed in this study can serve as a foundation for developing effective customer retention strategies and improving overall customer satisfaction in the banking sector.
